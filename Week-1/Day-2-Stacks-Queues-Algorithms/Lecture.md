## ðŸ“š Stacks and Queues

**Duration: 2 hours**

### Understanding Stacks and Queues

Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures with distinct behaviors:
- **Stacks**: Follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queues**: Follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

### Key Concepts

- **Operations**: Stacks support push and pop operations, while queues support enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Applications**: Stacks are useful in scenarios like function call stack, expression evaluation, and undo functionality. Queues find applications in CPU scheduling, printer queue management, and breadth-first search.

### JavaScript Implementation

Let's delve into practical implementations using JavaScript:

```javascript
// Stack Implementation
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  push(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return "Underflow";
    }
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  // Other methods...
}

// Queue Implementation
class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  enqueue(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  dequeue() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return "Underflow";
    }
    return this.items.shift();
  }

  // Other methods...
}
```

### Use Cases

Explore how stacks and queues are employed in various real-world scenarios to solve problems efficiently.

## ðŸ§  Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking

**Duration: 2 hours**

### Basics of Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or accomplish a task. Let's lay the groundwork:

- **Definition**: What constitutes an algorithm?
- **Properties**: Discuss the characteristics of a good algorithm, such as correctness, efficiency, and optimality.

### Binary Search Algorithm

Introduce one of the most efficient search algorithms, binary search:
- **Principle**: Divide and conquer approach.
- **Implementation**: Explore how binary search operates on a sorted array.

### Basic Problem-Solving Strategies

Equip yourself with fundamental problem-solving strategies:
- **Brute Force**: Exhaustive search for solutions.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices at each stage.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems.

### Practical Applications

Highlight practical applications of algorithmic thinking in various domains, from software engineering to daily life problem-solving.
