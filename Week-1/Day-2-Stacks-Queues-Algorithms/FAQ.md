# FAQ: Stacks, Queues, and Algorithmic Thinking

## Stacks and Queues

### What are stacks and queues?

- **Stacks**: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the top.
- **Queues**: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### How are stacks and queues implemented?

- **Stacks**: Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The push and pop operations are used to add and remove elements, respectively.
- **Queues**: Queues can also be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The enqueue and dequeue operations are used to add and remove elements, respectively.

### What are some real-world applications of stacks and queues?

- **Stacks**: Stacks are used in function call stack, expression evaluation, undo functionality in text editors, and backtracking algorithms.
- **Queues**: Queues are used in CPU scheduling, printer queue management, breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs, and asynchronous task processing.

### How do I check if parentheses are balanced using a stack?

You can use a stack to check if parentheses in a string are balanced by iterating through the string and pushing opening parentheses onto the stack and popping them off when encountering closing parentheses. At the end, if the stack is empty, the parentheses are balanced.

## Algorithmic Thinking

### What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. Algorithms are used in computer science to perform calculations, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.

### What is binary search and how does it work?

Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty. Binary search is efficient, with a time complexity of O(log n) for sorted arrays.

### What are some basic problem-solving strategies?

- **Brute Force**: Exhaustive search method where all possible solutions are tried.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem independently, and combining their solutions to find the overall solution.

### How can I improve my problem-solving skills?

Practice regularly, work on diverse problem sets, understand different algorithmic techniques, and analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions. Additionally, discussing problems with peers and seeking feedback can help improve problem-solving skills.
