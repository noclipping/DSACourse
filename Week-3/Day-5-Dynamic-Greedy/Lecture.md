### ðŸš€ Day 5 Lecture: Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸš€ Introduction to Dynamic Programming

**Duration: 2 hours**

### Understanding Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Let's explore its core concepts:

- **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution of the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Subproblems may recur many times, and solutions to them can be cached and reused.

### Solving 1-D Dynamic Programming Problems

Learn how to solve simple 1-D dynamic programming problems using techniques like memoization and bottom-up dynamic programming. Example problems include:

- Fibonacci sequence calculation.
- Coin change problem.

### Solving Basic 2-D Dynamic Programming Problems

Delve into solving basic 2-D dynamic programming problems, where solutions depend on two parameters. Example problems include:

- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem.
- Matrix Chain Multiplication.

## ðŸŒŸ Basics of Greedy Algorithms

**Duration: 2 hours**

### Understanding Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms make a series of choices at each step, aiming to find the optimal solution for the whole problem. Key characteristics include:

- **Greedy Choice Property**: Making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- **No Backtracking**: Once a decision is made, it cannot be undone.

### Comparing Greedy Algorithms with Dynamic Programming

Explore the differences between greedy algorithms and dynamic programming:

- **Optimality**: Greedy algorithms may not always produce optimal solutions, while dynamic programming guarantees optimal solutions.
- **Efficiency**: Greedy algorithms are often more efficient but may not always produce the best result.

### Examples of Greedy Algorithms

Discover examples of problems solved using greedy algorithms:

- Fractional Knapsack Problem.
- Huffman Coding for data compression.
