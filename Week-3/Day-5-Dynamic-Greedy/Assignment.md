Here's the assignment for Day 5:

# Assignment: Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms

## Dynamic Programming

### Question 1: **Fibonacci Sequence**

Implement a function in JavaScript to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming. Use memoization to optimize the solution.

**Sample Code:**

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  // Your code here
}
```

### Question 2: **Longest Common Subsequence**

Write a function in JavaScript to find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two given strings. Use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

**Sample Code:**

```javascript
function longestCommonSubsequence(str1, str2) {
  // Your code here
}
```

## Greedy Algorithms

### Question 3: **Fractional Knapsack Problem**

Implement a function in JavaScript to solve the fractional knapsack problem using a greedy algorithm. The function should take an array of items with their weights and values, and the capacity of the knapsack, and return the maximum value that can be obtained.

**Sample Code:**

```javascript
function fractionalKnapsack(items, capacity) {
  // Your code here
}
```

### Question 4: **Huffman Coding**

Write a function in JavaScript to perform Huffman coding for a given set of characters and their frequencies. Use a greedy algorithm to construct the Huffman tree and generate the encoded binary strings for each character.

**Sample Code:**

```javascript
function huffmanCoding(characters, frequencies) {
  // Your code here
}
```

## Submission Guidelines

- Write your solutions in separate JavaScript files for each problem.
- Ensure your code runs correctly and handles different test cases.
- Submit your files through the course platform before the deadline.
