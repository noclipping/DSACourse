Here's the lecture for Day 4:

### üìä Day 4 Lecture: Graphs and Basic Graph Algorithms üìà

## üìä Overview of Graphs

**Duration: 2 hours**

### Understanding Graphs

Graphs are versatile data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. Let's explore their components:

- **Vertices**: Nodes representing entities.
- **Edges**: Connections between vertices.
- **Directed vs. Undirected Graphs**: Edges may or may not have a direction.

### Representation of Graphs

Learn about different representations of graphs:

- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array indicating connections between vertices.
- **Adjacency List**: A collection of lists or arrays, where each vertex maintains a list of adjacent vertices.

### Traversal Techniques

Explore popular traversal techniques:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore all neighbor vertices at the present depth before moving to the next depth level.

## üõ§Ô∏è Simple Pathfinding and Real-World Applications

**Duration: 2 hours**

### Pathfinding Algorithms

Discover basic pathfinding algorithms:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
- **A\* Algorithm**: A heuristic-based search algorithm used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

### Real-World Applications of Graphs

Explore how graphs are used in various real-world scenarios:

- **Social Networks**: Modeling relationships between individuals.
- **Transportation Networks**: Optimizing routes and schedules.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting products or content based on user preferences.

### Case Studies

Delve into case studies demonstrating the practical applications of graph algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as:

- Route planning and navigation in mapping applications.
- Network analysis and optimization in telecommunications.
- Fraud detection and anomaly detection in financial systems.

## üîÑ Wrap-Up and Q&A

**Duration: 30 minutes**

### Recap

Today, we delved into the world of graphs, exploring their representation, traversal techniques, and practical applications in pathfinding and beyond.
