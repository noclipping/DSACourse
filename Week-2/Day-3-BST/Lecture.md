### ðŸŒ³ Day 3 Lecture: Trees and Binary Search Trees ðŸŒ²

## ðŸŒ³ Introduction to Trees

**Duration: 2 hours**

### Understanding Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes connected by edges. Let's explore their characteristics:

- **Root**: The topmost node in a tree.
- **Parent, Child, Sibling**: Relationship between nodes.
- **Leaf Node**: Node with no children.
- **Height**: Length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

### Traversal Techniques

Learn about different traversal techniques to visit nodes in a tree:

- **In-order Traversal**: Visit left subtree, then root, then right subtree.
- **Pre-order Traversal**: Visit root, then left subtree, then right subtree.
- **Post-order Traversal**: Visit left subtree, then right subtree, then root.

### Applications of Trees

Explore the wide range of applications where trees are used, including:

- File systems and directory structures.
- Representing hierarchical data like organization charts.
- Parsing expressions and syntax trees in compilers.

## ðŸŒ² Deep Dive into Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

**Duration: 2 hours**

### Understanding Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree with the following properties:

- Each node has at most two children: left child and right child.
- For any node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.

### Operations on BSTs

Learn about the fundamental operations on BSTs:

- **Insertion**: Adding a new node while maintaining the BST property.
- **Deletion**: Removing a node while preserving the BST structure.
- **Search**: Finding a specific element efficiently.

### Balancing Concepts

Discuss balancing concepts to ensure optimal performance of BSTs:

- **Balanced Trees**: Trees where the height difference between left and right subtrees is minimized.
- **Self-balancing Trees**: Trees that automatically adjust their structure to maintain balance, like AVL trees and Red-Black trees.

### Usage of BSTs

Explore various applications where BSTs excel:

- Efficient searching and retrieval of data.
- Implementing dictionary data structures.
- Range queries and finding closest elements.
