# FAQ: Trees and Binary Search Trees

## Trees

### What is a tree data structure?

A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes connected by edges. It consists of a root node, which is the topmost node, and zero or more child nodes connected to it.

### What are the different traversal techniques for binary trees?

- **In-order Traversal**: Visit left subtree, then root, then right subtree.
- **Pre-order Traversal**: Visit root, then left subtree, then right subtree.
- **Post-order Traversal**: Visit left subtree, then right subtree, then root.

### What is the height of a binary tree?

The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. It represents the depth of the deepest leaf node in the tree.

### Can a binary tree have a height of 0?

Yes, a binary tree with only the root node (no children) has a height of 0.

## Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

### What is a binary search tree (BST)?

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree in which the value of each node is greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

### How do you validate if a binary tree is a valid BST?

To validate if a binary tree is a valid BST, you need to check if the values of all nodes follow the BST property: for each node, its value should be greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree.

### What is the in-order successor of a node in a BST?

The in-order successor of a node in a binary search tree (BST) is the node with the smallest key greater than the node's key. In other words, it is the next node in an in-order traversal of the BST.

### Can a binary search tree have duplicate values?

It depends on the specific implementation. In some implementations, duplicate values are allowed, while in others, they are not. Generally, BSTs with duplicate values require additional rules for insertion and deletion to maintain the BST property.
